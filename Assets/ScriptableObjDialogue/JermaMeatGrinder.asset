  - Okay, if I... if I chop you up in a meat grinder, and the only thing that comes
    out, that's left of you, is your eyeball, you'r- you're PROBABLY DEAD! You're
    probably going to - not you, I'm just sayin', like, if you- if somebody were
    to, like, push you into a meat grinder, and, like, your- one of your finger bones
    is still intact, they're not gonna pick it up and go, "Well see, yeah it wasn't
    deadly, it wasn't an instant kill move! You still got, like, this part of your
    finger left!" NO I'M NOT GONNA PUT YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. I'M NOT GONNA PUT
    YOU INTO A MEAT GRINDER. NO. I'm making a reference to the fact that, like, if
    I, like, if I were to get fucking KILLED... I don't know, YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYIN'.
    If- if- okay, if you were to- okay we're gonna take humans out of this, if alien
    Globgobglobgo 1 fuckin' shoots a disintegrating ray at alien Globglo 2, if there's
    only fucking TEETH LEFT, it's- it's fucking you're dead, you're dead.
